Common Errors:

    if-else: 
        * In a function, a return statement doesn't exist if the "if condition" is not true.
    
    switch-case:
        * Without a break statement, the compiler will continue executing subsequent statements until it reaches a break.
    
    while:
        * The loop runs on forever because the condition is never false.
    
    for loop:
        * In a nested for loop, the index uses the same variable "i".
